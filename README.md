# Installation

Use [Distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/) to run [OBS Studio Portable]() on any Linux üêß distro.

- The OBS Studio configuration is exposed in your home directory on the host via the `~/.config/obs-portable` directory.
- Launching multiple instances of OBS Studio Portable containers is not recommended as the configuration location is shared.

**Running a single instance of OBS Studio Portable works great!**

1. Install Distrobox (*1.4.2.1 or newer*) and Podman (*recommended*) or Docker.
2. Create a Distrobox container for OBS Studio Portable.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/ublue-os/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull
```

## NVIDIA support

The appropriate NVIDIA libraries on the host should be automatically be linked inside the container ü™Ñ
However the capability for Distrobox to automatically connect NVIDIA libraries was recently added in Distrobox 1.5.0, and is also not supported on all distros; NixOS for example.

Therefore, if your are running an older version of Distrobox or the NVIDIA drivers are not automatically linked inside the container you can install them as follows:
  - Change the version number (***535** in the example below*) to match the version of the NVIDIA drivers you have installed on the host.

### NVIDIA complete driver stack

Required if the display is rendered by an NVIDIA GPU.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/ublue-os/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull --additional-packages nvidia-driver-535
```

### NVIDIA compute only

Suitable for multi-GPU systems where the NVIDIA GPU is not rendering the display and only being used for compute.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/ublue-os/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull --additional-packages libnvidia-encode-535 nvidia-headless-no-dkms-535

3. Run the initial setup.

```bash
distrobox enter --name obs -- true
```

4. From now on, launch OBS Studio Portable using the `obs-portable` launcher.

```bash
distrobox enter --name obs -- /opt/obs-portable/obs-portable
```

If the OBS Studio Portable container cannot connect to the host X11 server, add [`xhost +si:localuser:$USER`](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#compatibility-notes) to `~/.distroboxrc`.
